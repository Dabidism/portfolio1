          Nowadays, university gate entry and exit systems have a huge role in
          premises security, traditional methods like ID checks or manual
          logbook records are often used to entry access university gate
          systems. However These methods can cause human error, without a
          real-time system, security personnel may have difficulty monitoring
          incoming vehicles which could increase the risk of security
          violations. <br /><br />
          The proposed Smart Vehicle Gate Pass System, which integrates Radio
          Frequency Identification (RFID) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition
          (ANPR) technologies, aims to address these issues by providing a
          smart, web-based platform for the university premises. Each registered
          vehicle has a unique RFID tag that instantly detects as it approaches
          the campus gate. While this happens, a high-resolution camera captures
          the license plate, to verify the plate number registered based on the
          database record. By combining an RFID tag and ANPR it cross-match the
          recorded data based on the registered vehicles, the system can reduce
          the risk of tag-cloning, transferring to another vehicle, or license
          plate forgery. It also automates the process of logging each vehicle's
          entry and exit, including vehicle information, timestamps, and parking
          status, without the need for manual input. This dual-verification
          method improves the accuracy of vehicle identification while reducing
          the chances of human error. Additionally, the automated data
          collection and verification helps lessen the administrative workload,
          enhances response times, and streamlines overall gate operations.
          <br /><br />This system is based on contemporary studies and
          real-world implementations of vehicle access systems across
          educational establishments. It responds to the prominent gap in
          campus-level adoption of integrated, technological-driven gate pass
          systems. With features such as real-time vehicle tracking, online
          registration approval, parking availability monitoring, vehicle
          logging, and data analytics records, the proposed system aligns with
          the global smart campus system. <br /><br />Eventually, the objective
          of this study lies in its contribution to campus safety, working
          efficiency, and digital modification. Introducing a model that is both
          versatile and expandable. Moreover not only supports Iloilo Science
          and Technology University (ISAT-U) in its purpose but provides its
          technological innovation and a helpful consideration for other
          institutions aiming to modernize their campus security system.
